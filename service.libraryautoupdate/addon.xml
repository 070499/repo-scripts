    <summary lang="en">Update your XBMC Video and Music Libraries on a timer. Recently rewritten to run as an XBMC Service.</summary>
    <description lang="en">This is an XBMC Service that will update your music and video libraries on a timer. You can select an interval to scan and which databases (Music, Video, or Both) you want to have scanned. If you are playing an audio or video file when the timer starts it will skip the library update process until it is completed so that you're media experience is not interrupted. </description>
