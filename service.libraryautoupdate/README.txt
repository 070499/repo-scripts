The XBMC Library Updater will update your music and/or video libraries according to times specified by you. 

Things to keep in mind:
	Restarting XBMC will no longer automatically start a library update. The timer now keeps track of the last time it updated via a written file so restarts that happen in between updates may not necessarily trigger an update unless it is needed.
